%% This is a dissertation template for use with Masters/PhD dissertations at the University of Arizona.
%%
%% This template was created in 2022 by Samuel A. Myers to greatly simplify the existing thesis template.
%% This was done to make the template easier to use, less intimidating, and be because the old template had
%% not been actively updated in over a decade. Furthermore, in recent years the Grad College has greatly
%% relaxed thesis requirmenets, and so the hyperspecific formatting guidelines utilized in the old template
%% were no longer relevant. 
%%
%% Also note that all of the AAS compatability has been explicitly removed, however it can easily be added back
%% by simply including the relevant packages in the preamble. This shouldn't break the template (with the exeption
%% of deluxetable, which is evil and should never be used).
%%
%% This template was made to match the guidelines as listed here (https://arizona.app.box.com/v/grad-gsas-dissformat)
%% in May of 2022. As always, check to make sure that your thesis is compliant before submitting it. If you
%% find any errors, please let the current LPL template manager or grad webmaster know. Furthermore, Be aware that 
%% there are some "secret" requirements that they don't tell you about until you are submitting your thesis. For
%% the most part these should be small things, but if you have problems, reach out to the template manager.
%%
%% This template is based on an existing template that utilized a custom LaTeX class. That template was
%% worked on from the late 80's to early 2000's by a series of graduate students in the Department of
%% Planetary Sciences. Although much of that template has been scrapped, this template is still heavily based
%% on it, and much of their sample text has been utilized. The following is a list of all the students who
%% have worked on various thesis templates.
%%
%% Peter Halverson	1989 (non-LPL)
%% William D. Sears	1994
%% Rov Vervack		1996
%% Andrew Rivkin	1997
%% Joe Spitale		2001
%% Dave O'Brien		2003
%% Ross A. Beyer	2004
%% Jim Richardson	2005
%% Terry Hurford	2005
%% Curtis S. Cooper	2007
%% David A. Minton  2009
%% Samuel A. Myers	2022
%%
%% To compile this template, the recommend run sequence is:
%% PdfLaTeX + Bib(la)tex + PdfLaTeX (x2)
%% This should ensure the references, figures, tables, table of contents, etc are all updated fully and correctly.
%%
%% If you have any questions and its before ~2026, please feel free to email sammyers@arizona.edu

%----------------------------------------Example Chapter--------------------------------------------------
\chapter{Sample Chapter}
\thispagestyle{fancy} %Resets custom page number location on first chapter page

\section{Introduction}
This is an example of a numbered section. You can also created unnumbered sections and subsections, although
I recommend against it. If you create unnumbered sections you will have to add them to the Table of Contents 
manually with the \texttt{addcontentsline} command. \footnote{By the way footnotes are a thing}.\\

\textit{Note: All titles (chapters, sections, subsections, etc must be in Title Case.)} 

\section*{An Unnumbered Section}
This is an unnumbered section that has not been added to the Table of Contents.

\subsection{Subsections!}
You can also create subsections. They follow the same rules as sections.


\section{Math Example}
This is a real short example of using the equation environment.

\begin{equation}
	y = mx + b
\end{equation}

There is an awful lot that the equation environment and math mode can do for you.


\section{References}
Here is an example of references using the natbib package. You can reference in a number of ways.  The
ones that are most useful are parenthetical \citep{article,articletwo} or inline, as in \citet{articletwo} 
said this or that. You can also include information within the citation \citep[e.g.][doesn't have any
page numbers]{2003jgr}.  You don't even need to have the reference in your text to be included. \nocite{2004LPI}

You can also cite your references directly inline using the \texttt{bibentry} command as follows: \bibentry{article}


\section{Figures} \label{section:figures}
On the next page is a figure inclusion using the `graphicx' package. This puts figures on their own page by 
themselves. They don't need to be on separate pages, there is no requirement that they be on separate pages.
If you want to put a figure on a page with text, don't include the \emph{p!} option in square brackets at 
the begin figure command.

You can use most common file types with this package. Just make sure the file extension listed in the command
matches the actual file.

Also note that the \verb=\caption= command has an optional square-bracketed argument and a curly-bracketed 
argument.  Whatever you put in square brackets will be used as the short caption, and will go into the 
List of Figures.  The stuff in the curly brackets will be placed on the page under your figure.


\begin{figure}[p!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{figure.eps}
\caption[Short figure caption for LOF]{Sample figure caption (to appear below
the actual figure). \label{samplefig}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

You can reference a figure later using the \verb=\label= command (Figure~\ref{samplefig}). This can also be
done for sections and chapters (Section~\ref{section:figures}).





%----------------------------------Example Chapter 2: Electric Boogaloo-----------------------------------------
% You can also use the input command to include separate tex files. Try to avoid the input command as it may 
% break the formatting (or more often just straight up not work).
\input{Paper1.tex}

\input{Paper2.tex}



%----------------------------------------Appendices--------------------------------------------------------
% Appendices are not required. To remove them simply comment out all of the lines betweeen here and the next
% section. There is no limit on the number of appendices. If included they must go after regular chapters and
% before the references.
\appendix
\chapter{A Wild Appendix Appeared}
\thispagestyle{fancy} %Resets custom page number location on first appendix page

This is an appendix. Put appendixy things in it.
