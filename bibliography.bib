abstract = {The coupled effects of kinetics, solar cycle flux variations and vertical transport on the distribution of long-lived hydrogen-carbon-oxygen compounds in the terrestrial mesosphere and lower thermosphere are studied using a one-dimensional aeronomy model. The calculations account for the important chemical reactions and use rocket measurements of the solar flux at solar minimum and maximum. Photodissociation rates appropriate for the mesosphere are determined with a spherical shell atmosphere formalism; detailed corrections for the O2 Schumann-Runge bands and the temperature dependence of the CO2 cross sections are used. Then an eddy diffusion profile is derived which gives agreement with the Aladdin 74 mass spectral measurements of atomic O, O2, CO2, and Ar in the lower thermosphere and observations of the O3 minimum at ∼80 km. The 115 GHz CO radio emission line computed for the CO mixing ratio profile predicted with the new eddy diffusion profile compares well with recent observations of W. J. Wilson. Differences between the calculated CO mixing ratio profile and previous theoretical and observational determinations are discussed. Our derived eddy diffusion profile has a sudden decrease at 92 km which is necessary to produce the atomic O peak at 98 km that appears in the Aladdin 74 measurements. This stagnant region apparently is a recurrent or persistent feature of the upper atmosphere since an atomic O peak around 98 km has been seen by different techniques in different seasons over several years. Slow eddy diffusion in the lower thermosphere through the homopause was also the conclusion of earlier Ar/N2 rocket measurements studies. The analytic approach of this paper could be used in the future to monitor variations in middle atmosphere dynamics, if regularly conducted simultaneous observations of various groups of species were available.},

abstract = {Thermal emission spectra calculated using Voyager Jupiter radio occultation (RSS) temperature profiles rescaled to the Galileo probe value of the helium abundance do not agree with the spectra measured by the Voyager infrared spectrometer (IRIS). The ∼2 K offset in brightness temperature suggests the possibility of a systematic error source yet to be identified. This raises the question of the validity of the Voyager Saturn helium abundance that was determined using the same RSS–IRIS approach. We address this issue by developing an inversion algorithm for the simultaneous retrieval of the temperature, the para H2 fraction, and the helium abundance from the IRIS spectra alone. This approach can not be successfully applied to Jupiter because of strong gaseous NH3 and cloud opacity near the low-frequency end of the spectrum, but this restriction is less severe at the lower temperatures of Saturn. Applications of the algorithm to Saturn spectra yield a volume mixing ratio He/H2 between 0.11 and 0.16 corresponding to a helium mass fraction relative to the total helium and hydrogen in Saturn's atmosphere of Y=0.18–0.25. Although these retrievals depend on subjective filtering of the solutions in the inversion algorithm to reduce the range of non-uniqueness for the helium values, they strongly suggest a value for He/H2 significantly larger than the value of 0.034±0.024 previously obtained by Conrath et al. (Conrath, B. J., D. Gautier, R. A. Hanel, and J. S. Hornstein 1984, Astrophys. J.282, 807–815) using the RSS–IRIS method.}

The mole fractions show no hemispherical asymmetries or latitudinal variability. The analysis combines data from the far-IR methane rotational lines and the mid-IR features of methane and its isotopologues, using both the correlated-k retrieval algorithm of Irwin et al. [Irwin, P., and 9 colleagues, 2008. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 109, 1136–1150] and a line-by-line approach to evaluate the reliability of the retrieved quantities. C/H was found to be enhanced by 10.9±0.5 times the solar composition of Grevesse et al. [Grevesse, N., Asplund, M., Sauval, A., 2007. Space Sci. Rev. 130 (1), 105–114], 2.25±0.55 times larger than the enrichment on Jupiter, and supporting the increasing fractional core mass with distance from the Sun predicted by the core accretion model of planetary formation. A comparison of the jovian and saturnian C/N, C/S and C/P ratios suggests different reservoirs of the trapped volatiles in a primordial solar nebula whose composition varies with distance from the Sun. This is supported by our derived D/H ratio in methane of (1.6±0.2)×10−5, which appears to be smaller than the jovian value of Lellouch et al. [Lellouch, E., Bézard, B., Fouchet, T., Feuchtgruber, H., Encrenaz, T., de Graauw, T., 2001. Astron. Astrophys. 370, 610–622]. Mid-IR emission features provided an estimate of C12/C13=91.8−7.8+8.4, which is consistent with both the terrestrial ratio and jovian ratio, suggesting that carbon was accreted from a shared reservoir for all of the planets.}

abstract = {Measuring the spatial distribution of chemical compounds in Saturn’s stratosphere is critical to better understand the planet’s photochemistry and dynamics. Here we present an analysis of infrared spectra in the range 600–1400cm−1 acquired in limb geometry by the Cassini spacecraft between March 2005 and January 2008. We first determine the vertical temperature profiles from 3 to 0.01hPa, at latitudes ranging from 70°N to 80°S. We infer a similar meridional temperature gradient at 1–2hPa as in recent previous studies [Fletcher, L.N., Irwin, P.G.J., Teanby, N.A., Orton, G.S., Parrish, P.D., de Kok, R., Howett, C., Calcutt, S.B., Bowles, N., Taylor, F.W., 2007. Icarus 189, 457–478; Howett, C.J.A., Irwin, P.G.J., Teanby, N.A., Simon-Miller, A., Calcutt, S.B., Fletcher, L.N., de Kok, R., 2007. Icarus 190, 556–572]. We then retrieve the vertical profiles of C2H6 and C2H2 from 3 to 0.01hPa and of C3H8 around 1hPa. At 1hPa, the meridional variation of C2H2 is found to follow the yearly averaged solar insolation, except for a strong equatorial mole fraction of 8×10-7, nearly two times higher than expected. This enhancement in abundance can be explained by the descent of hydrocarbon-rich air, with a vertical wind speed at the equator of 0.25±0.1mm/s at 1hPa and 0.4±0.15mm/s at 0.1hPa. The ethane distribution is relatively uniform at 1hPa, with only a moderate 25 percent increase from 35°S to 80°S. Propane is found to increase from north to south by a factor of 1.9, suggesting that its lifetime may be shorter than Saturn’s year at 1hPa. At high altitudes (1Pa), C2H2 and C2H6 abundances depart significantly from the photochemical model predictions of Moses and Greathouse [Moses, J.I., Greathouse, T.K., 2005. J. Geophys. Res. 110, 9007], except at high southern latitudes (62, 70 and 80°S) and near the equator. The observed abundances are found strongly depleted in the 20–40°S region and enhanced in the 20–30°N region, the latter coinciding with the ring’s shadow. We favor a dynamical explanation for these anomalies.}

abstract = {Stellar occultations observed by the Cassini/UVIS instrument provide unique data that probe the mesosphere and lower thermosphere of Titan at altitudes between 400 and 1400km. This region is a site of complex photochemistry that forms hydrocarbon and nitrile species, and plays a crucial role in the formation of the organic hazes observed in the stratosphere, but has yet to be adequately characterized. We analyzed publicly available data obtained between flybys Tb in December 2004 and T58 in July 2009, with an emphasis on two stable occultations obtained during flybys T41 and T53. We derived detailed density profiles for CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C4H2, HCN, HC3N and C6H6 between ∼400 and 1200km and extinction coefficients for aerosols between 400 and 900km. Our analysis reveals the presence of extinction layers in the occultation data that are associated with large perturbations in the density profiles of the gaseous species and extinction profiles of the aerosols. These relatively stable features vary in appearance with location and change slowly over time. In particular, we identify a sharp extinction layer between 450 and 550km that coincides with the detached haze layer. In line with recent images obtained by Cassini/ISS, the altitude of this layer changes rapidly around the equinox in 2009. Our results point to unexpected complexity that may have significant consequences for the dynamics and physical processes taking place in the upper atmosphere of Titan.}

We retrieved the density of H2 and thus the temperature at altitudes higher than 1900km above the 1bar level by analyzing the ionization continuum of H2 at wavelengths shorter than 804Å. We find that the exospheric temperature ranges from 370K to 540K, with a typical uncertainty of less than 20K. According to our data the temperature increases with latitude from the equator to the poles by 100–150K. At similar latitudes, the temperature varies by 20–50K at different times with no evidence for any systematic diurnal trend so far. Based on our data, the exobase of Saturn is 2700–3000km above the 1bar level and the thermal escape parameter near the exobase ranges from 260 to 340, implying that thermal escape from Saturn is firmly in the Jeans regime. The mixing ratio of H2 is close to unity at all altitudes below the exobase. We find that the pressure levels in the thermosphere deviate significantly from a simple spheroid predicted by potential theory. This is consistent with significant meridional temperature variations in the lower thermosphere. A global analysis of the temperature structure at different depths in the atmosphere is required to constrain both the shape and the deposition and redistribution of energy in the upper atmosphere further.}

We calculate the altitudes corresponding to the pressure levels in each case based on our best fit composition model that includes H2, He, CH4 and upper limits on H. We match the altitude structure to the density profile in the thermosphere that is retrieved from the occultations. Our models depend on the abundance of helium and we derive a volume mixing ratio of 11  ±  2 percent for helium in the lower atmosphere based on a statistical analysis of the values derived for 32 different occultation locations.

abstract = {The variation of hydrocarbon abundances with altitude, latitude, and season in Saturn's stratosphere is investigated using a one-dimensional, time-variable, photochemical model. The results indicate that hydrocarbon abundances at pressures less than ∼0.01 mbar are extremely sensitive to solar flux variations due to changes in season, latitude, orbital radius, solar cycle, and ring shadowing. Long vertical diffusion times in the 0.01–1 mbar region introduce phase lags in the response to insolation changes. At pressures greater than 1 mbar, vertical diffusion timescales are longer than a Saturnian year. Therefore, relatively long-lived hydrocarbons like C2H2, C2H6, and C3H8 exhibit little seasonal variation in the lower stratosphere, and the yearly averaged solar insolation combined with vertical diffusion control species abundances in this region. Species with short photochemical lifetimes (e.g., CH3, C2H4) continue to experience seasonal variations, even at low altitudes. The model results are compared with infrared observations from the TEXES spectrometer at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility. We find that the observed C2H2 mixing-ratio variation with latitude is reasonably well predicted, whereas the C2H6 distribution is poorly predicted by the models. Meridional transport is likely affecting the distribution of C2H6, which has a long photochemical lifetime, whereas the distribution of shorter-lived C2H2 is controlled by photochemistry and vertical diffusion. Given the different observed behavior of C2H2 and C2H6, we constrain meridional transport timescales at 2 mbar on Saturn to be in the range ∼100–700 years, corresponding to meridional wind or diffusion speeds of ∼0.4–2 cm s−1.},
